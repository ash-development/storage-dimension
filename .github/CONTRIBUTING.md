# Contributing
Hi! Thanks for your interest in helping contribute to my mod! Please make sure to read the [README](https://github.com/ash-development/storage-dimension/issues) for an overview of the project. A big note before we continue is to please make sure you are using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) when creating commits.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/ash-development/storage-dimension/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/ash-development/storage-dimension/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/ash-development/storage-dimension/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. Feel free to speak up and we'll be happy to assign the issue to ya. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
